## MoSCoW Prioritization

### Must Have
- Develop an ASP.Net Core API with Entity Framework.
- Implement database migrations with at least two foreign key-linked tables.
- Create CRUD operations in the API.
- Integrate Angular SPA with the API and demonstrate CRUD functionality.
- Swagger documentation for the API.
- Topic calculation and project naming conventions in all files.

### Should Have
- A visually appealing SPA design using a CSS framework.
- Clear explanation and screenshots of software design patterns applied.
- Detailed README with step-by-step setup instructions.

### Could Have
- Additional features like user authentication or authorization.
- Responsive design for SPA on mobile and desktop devices.

### Won't Have
- Features outside the scope of CRUD operations and API integration (e.g., advanced analytics or AI features).

### Justifications
**Must Have:**
 - Entity Framework and the ASP.Net Core API are necessary for the backend 
   functionality.
 - It is necessary to exhibit appropriate database structure and relationships when 
   migrating databases with foreign key-linked tables.
 - CRUD activities in the API: Essential to the project's operation.
 - Angular SPA with API integration: Full-stack development with a working SPA was 
   required.
 - Swagger documentation is necessary in order to display and document the API.
 - Project naming conventions: To avoid plagiarism and guarantee correct arrangement.
   
**Should Have:**
 - SPA using CSS framework that is aesthetically pleasing: improves user experience without sacrificing functionality.
 - Software design pattern explanation: crucial for showcasing project optimization, but less significant than key features.
 - README with instructions for setting up: Not as important as the primary functionality, but necessary for clarity.
   
**Could Have:**
 - The feature "User authentication or authorization" is optional and not necessary for the course work.
 - Although it is not necessary, responsive SPA design improves user experience.

**Won't Have:**
 - "Advanced features (e.g., analytics)": The work makes no mention of or requirement for these.
